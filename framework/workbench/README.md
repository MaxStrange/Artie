# Artie Workbench

This folder contains the code for the Workbench application, which is what users will typically
interact with to control Artie, set up experiments, collect results, monitor statuses, etc.
It shares its code with ArtieTool, but provides a graphical user interface as opposed to ArtieTool's
much less friendly command line interface.
