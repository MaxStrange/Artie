# Bill of Materials

Some parts just can't be built :disappointed:

Here's the list of things you have to buy. I try to keep this as up-to-date as possible.

## Artie Aardvark

### Ear Assembly (x2)

**Make sure to get two of each of the following** (except where otherwise noted).

* [Adafruit MEMS Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3421)
* [Six of the Pins off of this Angle Pin Header](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1540) - You'll only need to buy one of these
  for both ear assemblies, as it has enough pins for both.

### Eyebrow Assembly (x2)

**Make sure to get two of each of the following** (except where otherwise noted).
