# Cloud Deployment

Under this model of deployment:

- You own, operate, and maintain Artie's hardware
- Artie compute required for administration is provided by the cloud
- Any additional compute required for experiments or workload is provided by the cloud

**Artie is under development, and this option is not available yet and may be removed entirely, depending on time constraints**

## Prerequisites

* An Artie robot that has been built and flashed with the latest firmware and OS images
    - [See here for instructions on how to do this](../building/building-artie-main.md)
